<div class="picture"><img src="disc_type_window.png" /></div>

<p>When you launch Devede, it will show you this window, asking what kind of disk you want to create.
You can choose between:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Video DVD: a classic video DVD, like the ones you rent in your videoclub or buy in your video shop.</li>
<li>VideoCD: a CD with CBR MPEG-1 video at a resolution of 352x240 pixels (352x288 with PAL), a fixed bitrate
of 1152 kbits/second for video and 224 kbits/second for audio. The quality is comparable to analog VHS,
and a CD can contain as much compressed audio/video than uncompressed audio (this is, a 80-minutes CD
can contain about 80 minutes of compressed video/audio). Is compatible with all DVD players, but video
quality is medium-bad.</li>
<li>Super VideoCD: a CD with VBR MPEG-2 video at a resolution of 480x480 pixels (480x576 with PAL) and
video bitrates between 500 and 2600 kbits/second. The quality is comparable to LaserDisc, and a 80-minutes CD
can contain about 60 minutes con compressed video/audio (more if you reduce the bitrate, but with less
quality). Is compatible with a lot of DVD players, but maybe there is one very cheap which doesn't support it.
Video quality is good.</li>
<li>CVD (China Video Disk): identical to Super VideoCD, but with a resolution of 352x480 pixels (352x576
with PAL). Offers less artifacts with same bitrate, but image is a bit less sharper than Super VideoCD. Is
compatible with a lot of DVD players, but maybe there is one very cheap which doesn't support it.</li>
<li>DIVX/MPEG4: creates DIVX files, ready to be played in DIVX-compliant players.</li>
<li>Matroska/H.264: creates matroska files with the H.264 codec, useful for HD content.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Of course you aren't limited to theses options, since you can choose, if you want, another resolution
for your CD/DVD. This allows you to create Super VideoCDs with a resolution of 352x240 (or 352x288 for PAL),
which is a very good compromise if you want to store a lot of video in a single CD. I don't recomend to use
other resolutions with VideoCDs, because CBR MPEG-1 is very limited. Choose the Super VideoCD or CVD option
(which uses VBR MPEG-2) and use there the resolution you want.</p>

<p>In the upper picture, the VideoCD, SuperVideoCD and China Video Disc are disabled. This is because the system
lacks some program needed to do it. To know which ones you need but haven't installed, just click the <b>Programs
needed by Devede</b> button.</p>
