<p class="section">Menu options</p>

<p>Devede allows to add a menu to the video DVDs. This menu will allow to jump to each title. Here you can see
the menu configuration window in a project with two files:</p>

<div class="picture"><img src="menu.png" /></div>

<p>The first block allows you to add a title to your menu. This title will be shown at the upper part of the menu.
 You can choose the font type, size and color, add a shadow under it with the color
you want, and change the place where it will be put.</p>

<p>When choosing a color you can set the transparency level by clicking the <b>plus</b> button in the <b>Custom</b> zone inside the color picker. If this value is
set to 0, that color will be fully transparent, so the element with that color will be invisible. If this value
is 255, that color will be fully opaque. With other values the element will be semitransparent, allowing to
"see through" it. An example: if you don't want Devede to add the black background rectangles under each title,
just set its opacity to 0, rendering it invisible.</p>

<p>The second block allows you to change the background picture. This way you can create a custom menu
for your DVD. You can use all picture formats supported by Gnome. Clicking the <b>Set default background</b> will
set again the default picture used by Devede: a white background with a DVD disk.</p>

<p>The third block allows to choose a sound file to use as soundtrack for the menu. By default the menus use
a file with 38 seconds of pure silence, but you can change it, having this way menus with music. Again, the
<b>Set menus without sound</b> button will restore the original silence file. Here you can also choose between MP2 and AC3
audio codec for the menu.</p>

<p>The next block allows you to choose the alignment. You can put the list of titles left, center or right aligned, and also
define some margins which will never be trespased (if there are too many files, the menu will be divided in several pages).
The value is set as percentage, so a value of 10 in the top margin will mean "10% from the
top of the screen".</p>

<p>The next block allows you to change the font style and size, and the colors used to render the inactive
text, the active text, the text background color and the shadow color. Again you can use transparency, in order to
remove the elements you don't want.</p>

<p>The button size will be automatically adapted to the font size.</p>

<p>The next block allows to decide if you want the menu to be shown when you put the disk in the
player, or only when you press the <b>Menu</b> button in the remote. In the later case, when the disk is inserted
it starts to play the first title.</p>
