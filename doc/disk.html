<p class="section">Creating the disk</p>

<div class="picture"><img src="create.png" /></div>

<p>After adding all the files you want and clicking in the <b>Forward</b> button, you will be prompted for a
directory where Devede will create all the files, and a generic name for them. The directory must have
enought free space to hold all the
temporary files (aprox. the double of the final CD/DVD size if you delete temporary files, or the triple if you
don't). The generic name will be used to name all
the temporary files, so the MPEG files will be named as GENERICNAME_XX_YY.MPG, the DVD tree directory will
be named GENERICNAME, the ISO image will be named GENERICNAME.ISO, and the BIN/CUE files will be
GENERICNAME.BIN and GENERICNAME.CUE.</p>

<p>You can also activate the checkbutton labeled <b>Shutdown computer when disc is done</b>. As it says, it shuts down the computer when the job is finished, allowing you to
leave your machine working at night. If there's an error, the computer won't be shut down.</p>

<p>Finally, the program will start to create the files. Remember that this is a very slow process, and can
need more than two hours to be completed, depending on the files. You will see this window with all the process:</p>

<p>If there is an error during the creation process, you will see a window like this:</p>

<div class="picture"><img src="error.png" /></div>

<p>There you can expand the <b>Debugging data</b> element and you will have access to the debugging info. You can
use the <b>Copy</b> button to copy all the text to the clipboard, and paste it into a mail, if needed.</p>

<p>Instead, if the disk image is created fine, you will see this window:</p>

<div class="picture"><img src="done.png" /></div>

<p>Here you can just click the <b>Burn</b> button and you will be able to burn the image in a DVD disc. Or you can
just click <b>OK</b> and burn it later using a DVD burning program like Brasero or K3b.</p>
