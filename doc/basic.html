<p class="section">Creating a disk: fast instructions</p>

<p>Before explaining all the options in Devede, here is the common sequence to create a disk.</p>

<p>First, you choose the disk type you want to create (DVD, VCD, sVCD, CVD or DivX). Then, you drag&amp;drop
the files you want in the main window, or add them with the <b>Add file</b> button.</p>

<p>If you want to add subtitles or fine-tune the properties of a file, you should use the <b>Properties</b> button.</p>

<p>Then you should click the <b>Adjust disk usage</b> button. This will automatically set the video bitrate for each
file (which depends on the final size of the file, if it has one or more subtitles, if it's already a converted
file...).</p>

<p>After that, use the <b>Menu options</b> button to ensure that you like the menu that Devede will create. If not,
you can use the available options to change them. Remember that the menu will use the names of the files, unless you
change them in the properties of each file.</p>

<p>Finally, just click the <b>Forward</b> button, choose a destination directory and a name, and enjoy a good
coffee while Devede works.</p>

<p>When the ISO or BIN/CUE file has been created, you can just click the <b>Burn</b> button to dump it into a physical disc</p>

<p class="section">Storing and restoring the disc structure</p>

<p>The options <b>Load</b>, <b>Save</b> and <b>Save as</b> in the <b>File</b> menu allow you to save
the current disk structure, in case you want continue your work later or reuse it for another,
slightly different, disk. Devede stores the disk format adding the extension <b>.devedeng</b> instead of the
old <i>.devede</i>, because the internal format has changed.</p>
